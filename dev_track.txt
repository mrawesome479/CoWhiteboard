====

Multiple user & Multiple board real time event with socket IO flow added,

data structure to cache the board information in node server:

boards = Map()

{
	"board-1": [board-1-elements],
	"board-2": [board-2-elements],
	...
}

userSessions = Map() 

{
	"userId": "socket.id / socket session id"
}

boardUserMapping = Map()

{
	"board-1": [user-1-id, user-2-id,...],
	"board-2": [user-1-id, user-2-id, user-3-id,...],
}

===
Rough flow:

User opens board UI in window 
	- user register / connect for socket with (userId & boardId) - server will create room with boardId and cache board elements in application data
===
Socket event Types:

USER_CONNECT
BOARD_JOINED
BOARD_STATE_CHANGE
BOARD_ELEMENT_UPDATE
BOARD_CLEAR
CURSOR_POSITION_CHANGE
UESR_DISCONNECT
===

USER_CONNECT - 
client opens board view then client sents USER_CONNECT event with userId, boardId, so user will join the room with boardId, if not exists room will get created and will update required data structures on server.
client will get latest board elements data for boardId with BOARD_JOINED on client, based on this client will update store with board elements, board active users data & active cursors.
